# 24-Spring_CNN-Enabled-Road-Gutter-Cleaning-Robot
At Ewha Womans University's 17th Challenge Semester, we crafted a Rain Gutter Detection Robot with CNN technology. It's designed to detect and clean rain gutters efficiently. With a CNN model, the robot autonomously identifies and cleans road gutters, ensuring optimal drainage and minimizing flooding risks.
